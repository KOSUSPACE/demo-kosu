## Demo Purpose

The purpose of this demo is to exhibit the build direction of KŌSU in order to share the foundation for our proof of concept.

## Familiarity

KŌSU UI and functionality borrows inspiration from some of the leading (MOOC) platforms to date.  This is intentionally done so that users can expect an experience they're already familiar with.  Uniswap is a leading DEX that laid the framework of the Swaps and Dex's we've come to know and love today.  Many projects followed the lead of Uniswap because it works and Blockchain users already know what to expect, making adoption simple and curveless.

We're taking the same approach.  Since, we're building on Blockchain, we want to make adoption effortless because Blockchain Technolgy is already embedded with a host of attributes that can be intimidating to new users.

Resemblance is the only common ground.  KŌSU has a far more rich mechanism with content distribution and rewards than traditional (MOOC) and LMS.  Not to mention, all courses are Free! Welcome to (MOOC) on Web3.:heart:
